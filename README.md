# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains various models for creating a movie recommendation system. Each model uses different methods to provide accurate and personalized movie recommendations. The main methods included are:

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked in the past.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Uses techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to uncover latent factors in user-item interactions.
- **Hybrid Methods**: Combines multiple approaches to enhance recommendation accuracy.

Each method is implemented in its respective subfolder, with detailed documentation and code examples provided.

## Installation
To install the necessary packages, run:
```sh
pip install <requirements>
```

## Usage
To run a specific model, navigate to its subfolder and execute the corresponding script. For example:
```sh
cd collaborative_filtering
python <main>.py
```
